# ðŸ¤– AI Usage Report â€“ AVI Nutrition SaaS Landing Page

## Tool Used:
**GitHub Copilot**

## How I Used Copilot:
I used GitHub Copilot throughout the development to rapidly generate clean and reusable components. Here's where Copilot assisted me most:

- ðŸ§± **Component Structure:**  
  Generated boilerplate for major sections like Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, CTA, and Footer.

- ðŸŽ¨ **Tailwind Styling Suggestions:**  
  Helped write responsive utility classes, dark mode variants, and animation-ready layouts.

- âš¡ **Theme Toggle Logic:**  
  Assisted in building a dark/light theme system using `localStorage` and `<html>` class toggling.

- ðŸŽ¥ **Animations:**  
  Suggested Framer Motion patterns for fade-in and slide-up effects on components.

## Why I Used Copilot:
- To move faster and reduce repetitive typing
- To auto-suggest component patterns and class combinations
- To focus more on UI/UX polish and architecture

## AI Efficiency Impact:
AI tools helped me:
- Speed up development by 40â€“50%
- Maintain clean, reusable component architecture
- Focus more on polish and responsiveness over boilerplate code

## Build Time:
ðŸ•’ **~2.5 hours**  
Built the full landing page with dark mode, reusable components, animations, and deployment in a single focused session.

> Copilot helped accelerate my workflow, but the design logic, component structure, and final UI choices were entirely mine.
