# Pantry Landing – Modern SaaS Landing Page


## Overview
Pantry Landing is a fully responsive, production-grade SaaS landing page built with Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Framer Motion. It features advanced dark/light mode, beautiful section transitions, and a polished, modern UI/UX designed to impress recruiters and users alike.

## Key Features
- **Next.js (App Router):** Modern file-based routing, SSR/SSG, and fast performance.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling, custom color palette, and responsive design.
- **TypeScript:** End-to-end type safety for maintainable code.
- **Framer Motion:** Advanced, smooth animations and transitions.
- **Lucide React:** Clean, modern icon set for UI polish.
- **Global Dark/Light Mode:** Accessible toggle in Navbar, with localStorage persistence and SSR-safe hydration.
- **Fully Responsive:** Mobile-first layouts, touch-friendly buttons, and adaptive spacing.
- **Beautiful Sections:** Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, CTA, Footer, and Navbar, all recruiter-polished.
- **Professional Color System:** Advanced blue/white palette for light mode, deep darks for dark mode.


## Development Process (with GitHub Copilot)
This project was developed iteratively using GitHub Copilot as an AI coding assistant. Key steps included:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
   - Set up Tailwind config for custom colors and dark mode.

2. **Section-by-Section Implementation**
   - Built each section (Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, CTA, Footer, Navbar) as a reusable component.
   - Used Framer Motion for advanced entrance and transition animations.
   - Ensured all sections are responsive and recruiter-ready.

3. **Dark/Light Mode**
   - Implemented a global ThemeToggle component with sun/moon icons.
   - Used localStorage and system preference for initial theme.
   - Ensured SSR hydration safety with a script in `layout.tsx`.
   - Updated all sections to use Tailwind’s `dark:` and custom light classes.

4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Adjusted all layouts, paddings, and font sizes for mobile screens.
   - Made all buttons and cards touch-friendly.

5. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Used advanced color combinations for a professional look.
   - Added shadows, borders, and gradients for depth.
   - Ensured all text and elements are visible and accessible in both themes.

6. **Error Fixes & Iteration**
   - Fixed all hydration, SSR, and styling issues as they arose.
   - Iteratively improved based on recruiter-focused feedback.
